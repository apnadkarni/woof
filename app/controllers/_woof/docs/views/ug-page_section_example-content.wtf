<h3>A Layout Example</h3>
<p>The following example illustrates some of the above principles
  described above. We use the simple example layout shown above.</p>
<p>Assume you are designing an application for a school, that contains
two controllers <span class="wf_code">teacher</span> and
<span class="wf_code">student</span>. Since there may be other applications
on the site, we create both these under <span class="wf_code">school</span>
module.</p>
